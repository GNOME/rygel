What is Rygel?

Rygel is a collection of UPnP/DLNA[1][2] devices, implemented through a plug-in
mechanism.

== Important facts and features ==
  * Specifically designed for GNOME (Mobile) and is therefore planned to be one
    of the key new features of Maemo[3] platform in the Harmattan[4] release.
  * Based on GUPnP[5].
  * Written (mostly) in Vala language[6]
  * APIs to ease the implementation of AV devices (currently only MediaServer[7]
    version 2.0 specification[8].
  * Export of on-disk media:
    * tracker[9] plugin.
    * Folder: Recursively exports folders specified in the user preferences.
  * Export of online media from 2nd German TV station[11].
  * Export of media hierarchies provided by external applications through
    implementation of D-Bus MediaServer spec[12]. Applications that utilize
    this feature are:
    * PulseAudio[13]: Provides streams for input/output devices on the system.
    * DVB Daemon[10]: Provides live TV (DVB) channel streams.
  * Audio and Video Transcoding: source format could be anything GStreamer's
    decodebin2 can handle but output formats are currently limited to: mp3, PCM
    and MPEG TS. Fortunately the transcoding framework is flexible enough to
    easily add more transcoding targets.
