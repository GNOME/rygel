    Rygel reads its configuration values from the file $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rygel.conf or a file
    given on command line with the --config option. If that file does not exist, it uses
    the file /etc/rygel.conf. Most of the options may be overriden by commandline arguments
    or environment variables. See rygel(1) for details on those.

    Lists in the configuration file are separated by a semicolon(;). Boolean values must be either
    the text true or the text false.
  values:
    - name: "ipv6"
      description: |
        Set to *false* if you do not want Rygel to run on IPv6 addersses.
        Whether or not IPv6 is actually supported depends on how GUPnP was configured.

        The available levels are 1 to 5, with 1 only logging critical errors and 5 being debug
        logging. All levels include messages of the levels below.

        To see log messages of level 5, it is also necessary to set the environment variable

    in favour of the LocalSearch plugin.

        A list of if URIs to expose via UPnP. It may be files, folder or anything supported by GVFS.
        If left empty it defaults to export the user's music, video and picture folders as defined
        by the XDG special user directories spec. These default folders can be referenced by @MUSIC@,
        @PICTURES@ and @VIDEOS@. Locations can be entered as either fully escaped URIs or normal paths.

        %%Note: If you enter a normal path that contains whitespace, there is no need to escape them with
        either a backslash or putting the string in quotes.

        %%Note: It is strongly advised against using an exported folder as a target for downloads when
        ``extract-metadata`` is enabled. Rygel will most likely ignore the files then because they will
        fail to extract while the download is ongoing.

  description: |
    Playbin is a default implementation of a DLNA Media Renderer, using GStreamer. It allows minimal
    customisation of the sinks used in the renderer. For example, to configure an audio-only renderer,
    set "audio-sink" to "autoaudiosink" and "video-sink" to "fakesink".
